# MyName Email Builder Notes
1) Created new repo and imported email-builder repo
2) Ran npm install and npm start as per https://github.com/foundation/foundation-emails-template
3) Dead links when running locally so added basic.html from foundation-emails-template/src/pages/basic.html to project
4) Added a wrapper for each section of alchemy-email, including text
5) Copied imgs into src/assets/img directory and updated img src paths


## General thoughts on the assessment
Should I use an existing template (e.g. basic.html) or build from scratch?
Is the example design intended for desktop? If so, should I alter the design for mobile?
** Shut down local server and run npm run build when ready to generate HTML w/inline styles.
I should commit more often; that first one was a fair chunk of the work!
After a few failed attempts at accessing imgs in email-assets file, esearched where img assets belong and copied them over into assets/img directory. According to tutorial on https://get.foundation/learn/adding-images-best-practices-foundation-for-emails-dave-horan.html you might have to restart server (npm run build) if imgs don't appear in dist file automatically.

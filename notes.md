# MyName Email Builder Notes
1) Created new repo and imported email-builder repo
2) Ran npm install and npm start as per https://github.com/foundation/foundation-emails-template
3) Dead links when running locally so added basic.html from foundation-emails-template/src/pages/basic.html to project


## General thoughts on the assessment
Should I use an existing template (e.g. basic.html) or build from scratch?
Is the example design intended for desktop? If so, should I alter the design for mobile?
** Shut down local server and run npm run build when ready to generate HTML w/inline styles.
